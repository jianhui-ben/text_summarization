# text_summarization
This repository is to experiment all the state-of-the-art techniques in abstractive text summarization and its relevant topics


The dataset is the Amazon food review data with 500K online reviews and human labelled summary for each of them. https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews

The ultimate goal of this project is to make an abstractive summarizer which can generate summaries undistinguishable to human.

The model I am going to try:

-LSTM with attention
-bi-LSTM with attention
-pre-trained transformers from huggingface library

Through the process, I also use the data to review some fundamental techiques in NLP&NLU.
-I try to re-create word embedding from scratch
-visulize the the word embeddings and sentence embedding.
